# My Password Generator

My password generator creates a unique, random password for the user.


## Background

This is an assignment using an existing base of code. My task was to complete the javascript code to have a working password generating program with the following features:
* User can choose criteria for which characters to include: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters.
* The program can handle incorrect input, and return appropriate messages to the user.
* User can choose any length for their password between 8 and 128 characters.
